# semantic-HTML-challenge

## Description

Refactor existing HTML to meet accessibility standards so that the site is optimised for search engines.

Following the **Scout Rule** I tidied up the code as I went along. This included condensing any CSS code while keeping in mind the **DRY method (Don't Repeat Yourself)**.

Some examples of the changes made include: Using semantic HTML tags, adding alt text to the images and icon elements, and that the code followed a logical sequence.

## Usage

To use this guide you can review the commits made for each step I took. Along with using Chrome DevTools where you can find the semantic code I have used in the HTML file along with the comments in the CSS file to show what changes I have made.
